# trsnic

trsnic is a general purpose TCP/IP network interface for the TRS-80 line of microcomputers.  It is a fork of and therefore derived from and inspired by Arno Puder's amazing <a href="https://github.com/apuder/RetroStoreCard">RestroStoreCard</a>.  The product will initially support the TRS-80 Model III and 4 as this is the current support level of the RetroStoreCard source repository.  The long term goal is to support all TRS-80s, including the Models I/II/III/4/12/16/16B/6000.
